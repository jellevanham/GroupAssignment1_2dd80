        "In this assignment, you will work with data on the expenditures of American households on 18 categories of supermarket goods. In **Part A**, you will apply the concepts you have learned in Chapter 6. You will first explore the data, by making beautiful plots and computing numerical summary statistics. In **Part B**, you will apply the concepts you have learned in Chapter 10 to compare the average expenditures across different categories or between different groups in the household sample. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can choose to focus your analyses on one of the following challenges. So the first thing you need to do as a team is to determine which challenge to work on. Then, you work on that one challenge for entire assignment (i.e. both **Part A** and **Part B**). \n",
        "- **Challenge 1:** Eating healthy has undeniable benefits to individuals and society as it reduces the risk of illness and improves feelings of well-being. What do the data tell about healthy consumption patterns? Questions can include, but are not limited to: Are expenditures in healthy and unhealthy categories correlated? Are there differences in expenditures on healthy consumption categories between family types? \n",
        "- **Challenge 2:** On November 7th 2020, US president-elect Joe Biden emphasized the importance of ''the battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country''. As consumption is driven by income, and income by opportunity, we would expect similar consumption patterns across races in a society without systemic racism. What do the data tell about spending patterns across racial groups? Questions can include, but are not limited to: In which categories do we see differences in expenditure levels between the racial groups? Are the correlations between the expenditures in the categories different between racial groups? \n",
        "- **Challenge 3:** The adverse effects of heavy smoking and alcohol consumption are well-known. What do the data tell us about expenditures on smoking an alcohol? Questions can include, but are not limited to: Are expenditures on smoking and alcohol correlated with each other, or with spending in other categories? Are the spending patterns on smoking and alcohol different in urban compared to rural areas?\n",
        "- **Open Challenge:** Did you think of another interesting challenge to work on with this data set? You can define your own challenge. You first discuss it with your instructor in the Assignment Q&A session. If the instructor agrees, you're all set to start working on your own challenge.  \n"

Meant with this, is taking a look at those who spent both money on smoking and alcohol. The scatterplot has been used to observe and show relationships between two numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. The biggest group can be found on the left downside of the plotgraph. So, concludable is that the participants will just only spend money on smoking or alcohol. But, there is also an group within the participant who spent money on both. "
